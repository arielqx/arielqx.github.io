Acquiring the relevant (cleaned) data-sets:

-   Looking at structure of data-frame of relevant match details:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
soccer <- read.csv("soccer21-22.csv")
weeklyrank <- read.csv("weeklyrank.csv")
str(soccer)
```

-   Looking at structure of data-frame of weekly rankings:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
str(weeklyrank)
```
